## Innovative Idea
Food & UMass is a website that focuses on the daily menu of the four Umass Dining Hall. It will be a place for students to share their thoughts on the food at dining halls. Users can score the food, leave comments, add pictures, and tag the dining hall location. Based on their peerâ€™s ratings, students could choose the best dining common to go each day. Currently we have Yelp on the market as a competitor but our website will be UMass oriented and tailored to the campus dining commons for students.

## Important Components
Data: Our website will update the menu everyday by fetching the menu from Umass Dining Website.

For every food, users can:
- Score the food
- Leave comments
- Add pictures
- Tag which dining common has
- See reviews from other users
